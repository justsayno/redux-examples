# Webpack Html Sass Starter

This is a very simple starter kit to get going with writing html and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) using [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/),
[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).

There are branches with different flavours of CSS frameworks. The master branch is just an empty project.

``` shell
git checkout materialize-css
```


## Quick start

To run development mode on localhost:3000:

``` shell
npm start
```

You can then edit `src/index.hml`, `src/index.scss` and `src/index.js` to create your html app.

To build to the public folder:

``` shell
npm run build
```
